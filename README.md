# John Wick Codex | The Unoffical John Wick Guide

This is the front-end prototype for a website called John Wick Codex
which by the name implies, is a guide for the John Wick Universe.

I made this project as I am a super fan of the John Wick
cinematic universe, as well as the universe-canon game
John Wick Hex.
